# Product Context: Fitness Tracker with MediaPipe

## Problem Statement

The fitness industry has seen a significant shift toward home workouts, accelerated by global events that limited access to gyms and fitness centers. While home workouts offer convenience and accessibility, they come with several challenges:

1. **Lack of Form Guidance**: Without a personal trainer or coach, many people perform exercises with improper form, which can lead to reduced effectiveness and potential injury.

2. **Difficulty Tracking Progress**: Home exercisers often struggle to accurately track their workouts, including repetitions, form quality, and improvements over time.

3. **Limited Feedback**: Unlike gym environments with mirrors and trainers, home workouts typically lack real-time feedback mechanisms to correct form issues.

4. **Motivation Challenges**: Without external accountability and feedback, maintaining motivation and proper technique can be difficult.

## Solution

The Fitness Tracker with MediaPipe addresses these challenges by leveraging computer vision and AI technologies to create a virtual fitness coach:

1. **Real-time Form Analysis**: Using MediaPipe's Holistic model, the application tracks body positions during exercises and provides immediate visual feedback on form.

2. **Automated Tracking**: The system automatically counts repetitions and measures form quality, eliminating the need for manual tracking.

3. **AI-Powered Coaching**: Integration with Google's Gemini API enables personalized feedback and recommendations based on the user's performance.

4. **Multi-modal Feedback**: The application provides feedback through multiple channels:
   - Visual overlays showing proper form and corrections
   - Audio coaching with verbal cues and encouragement
   - Text-based feedback with specific improvement suggestions

## User Experience Goals

The application aims to create an experience that is:

1. **Accessible**: Works on standard devices with a webcam, without requiring specialized equipment.

2. **Non-intrusive**: Provides guidance without disrupting the flow of the workout.

3. **Personalized**: Adapts feedback based on individual performance and progress.

4. **Educational**: Helps users understand proper form and technique, not just count repetitions.

5. **Motivational**: Encourages users through positive reinforcement and progress tracking.
