## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. ~~**Speech Synthesis Errors**: Occasional errors in audio feedback~~ (Fixed)
2. ~~**Reference Errors**: determineFeedbackSeverity function not defined~~ (Fixed)
3. ~~**Camera Crashes**: MediaPipe processing errors causing camera to crash~~ (Fixed)
4. **Pose Detection Stability**: MediaPipe sometimes loses tracking during rapid movements
5. **Rep Counting Accuracy**: Some exercises have false positives/negatives in rep counting
6. **Performance Issues**: High CPU usage on lower-end devices

### Medium Priority
1. **Audio Feedback Timing**: Occasional delays in audio feedback
2. **Gemini API Reliability**: API calls sometimes fail or timeout
3. **Mobile Usability**: Interface elements too small on mobile devices

### Low Priority
1. **Browser Compatibility**: Minor visual differences between browsers
2. **Form Analysis Edge Cases**: Unusual body proportions can affect analysis accuracy
3. **LocalStorage Limitations**: Limited storage capacity for exercise history

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**: Some analysis functions in script.js should be moved to separate modules
2. **Error Handling**: Need more comprehensive error handling for API failures
3. **Performance Optimization**: Render loop could be optimized for better performance
4. **Documentation**: Missing JSDoc comments for some functions
5. **Testing**: No automated tests implemented yet
